Difference between framework and library
framework is a combination of libraries and properties whereas library is a single library
in frameworks since all the libraries are installed at first it will continue to remain in the project even some libraries are not needed so it increases the bundle size of the project. but in librares only one library is installed and we can install other libraries if needed so it optimizes the bundle size.
